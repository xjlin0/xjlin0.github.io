Welcome to visit the site of Jack Jack Attack! As a <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev BootCamp</a> graduate, my blog here includes some discussion about certain web development topics, such as Javascript, Ruby and Rails. Thanks for coming and looking forward to have your tweets on <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@xjlin0">@xjlin0</a> or your comments on disqus.
