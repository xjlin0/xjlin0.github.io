### what happened to me when upset<img src="/assets/imgs/conflict.jpg"  alt="JackJackSupercharged" width="20%"/>

<div id="article">
  <p>Not long ago I spent a lot of time showing someone at the work how to do a complicate process which requires hours to get correct results. I spent lot of time to explain and work with him, but he repeatedly argued a setting that the boss already decided, and I can't change that at my position.  Around midnight we haven't finished but again he tried to change that setting. I fed up and tell him to finish that process alone and left.  But later on the result was wrong and unhappy.</p>
  <p>The source of my conflict feeling was, I put so much time trying to make this process smoothly and correctly, however, he still want to alter a setting which I was not authorized to change. I got upset and don't want to be involved for any possible resulting errors. I didn't take any actions and just left, which appear to be not the best solution. Because it's not the best idea to call the boss at midnight for non emergent events, I should have plainly tell him the reason behind and offer him the chance to talking to boss and decide later to prevent such error.</p>
  <p>What I learned from this case was: I am not that capable of handling my emotion, just like when I facing the intense situation in the pairing session. If a situation occurs, I should filter out my feeling, maybe by taking a break, frankly discuss with the other person, and offer a better solution to solve the situation. Thanks DBC for helping to find myself, maybe I will learn and change soon.</p>
